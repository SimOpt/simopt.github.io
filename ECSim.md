## Esophageal Cancer Simulator

### Introduction  

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a main sub-type of esophageal cancer, while Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor to EAC (see the figure below).
Recently, chemoprevention has received substantial attention as a method to lower the progression of BE to EAC, and aspirin and statin are two particular drugs that are demonstrated to be effective (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2011.08.036" target="_blank">Kastelein et al. 2011</a>).
For each BE patient, the progression rate to cancer depends on a variety of factors including age, weight, lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol use, the grade of dysplasia, etc.
In addition, each patient may have a different response to drugs depending on his or her drug resistance and tolerance.
Hence, it is conceivable that the best treatment regimen for BE is patient-specific.
