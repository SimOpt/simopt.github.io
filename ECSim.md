## [Esophageal Cancer Simulator](https://simopt.github.io/ECSim)

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a main sub-type of esophageal cancer, while Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor to EAC (see the figure below).
Recently, chemoprevention has received substantial attention as a method to lower the progression of BE to EAC, and aspirin and statin are two particular drugs that are demonstrated to be effective (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2011.08.036" target="_blank">Kastelein et al. 2011</a>).
For each BE patient, the progression rate to cancer depends on a variety of factors including age, weight, lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol use, the grade of dysplasia, etc.
In addition, each patient may have a different response to drugs depending on his or her drug resistance and tolerance.
Hence, it is conceivable that the best treatment regimen for BE is patient-specific.

Here is a discrete-time Markov chain model adopted from
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djh039" target="_blank">Hur et al. (2004)</a>
and 
<a href="http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/7/3/341" target="_blank">Choi et al. (2014)</a>
, and it simulates the transitions among different health states of a BE patient until death, and the transition diagram of the model is shown as follows.
See more details of the model <a href="https://simopt.github.io/code/ECSim/ModelDescription.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I have implemented this model and the codes were written in MATLAB R2018b.

with an example in it.
